            <p class="info-post-text">I attended the Math and Science specialty center at Clover Hill High School in Midlothian, Virginia. After high school, I was accepted into the Honors College at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), and began my studies in Fall 2023.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">In high school, I was the founder and president of our Technology-Student Association, and I spent several club meetings working with other members to help strengthen their programming and design abilities.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">At VCU, I was certain of my major immediately, and enrolled in the College of Engineering as a mechanical engineer. It combined my love for invention and design with complex problem solving, which felt like a perfect application of the tools I had learned through my personal work. My coursework also allowed me to design more complex and useful mechanisms than I had ever been able to and reinforced the joy I found in building something new. On top of my major, I also added a nuclear engineering concentration, as well as an aerospace minor. I hope to come back to education later in my life to enroll in a doctorate program for engineering. I've had a great experience with undergraduate research at VCU and I would love to continue onto a more ambitious project in the future, once I've established myself.</p>

            <p class="info-post-text">After beginning college, I joined a handful of student organizations and found my place within them. I was a part of the Mechanical Team for Hyperlabs, a team that competes in the Intelligent Ground Vehicles Competition for autonomously-navigating robots. I also joined the Game Creator's Coalition at VCU, a hub for game developers to show off their work, offer programming and design advice, and develop ideas. I'm also a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the American Nuclear Society at VCU.</p>

            <p class="info-post-text">I have a 3.8 GPA, and I have been on the Dean's List since Fall 2023. I've also taken several fundamental and more advanced engineering courses, the most relevant being: <b>Circuits</b> (EGRE 206), <b>CAE Design</b> (EGMN 420), <b>Multivariable Calculus</b> (MATH 307), <b>Computational Methods</b> (EGMN 210), <b>Differential Equations</b> (MATH 301), <b>Fluid Mechanics</b> (EGMN 301) <b>Project Management</b> (SCMA 350), <b>Heat Transfer</b> (EGMN 302), <b>Thermodynamics</b> (EGMN 204)</p>
