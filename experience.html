            <p class="info-post-text"><b>Position: </b>Undergraduate Research Intern</p>
            <p class="info-post-text"><b>Dates: </b>October 2023 — <i>Present</i></p>
            <p class="info-post-text"><b>Job Description:</b> At the Virginia Microelectronics Center (VMC), I work as an undergraduate research intern, assisting our lab 
              director Dr. Liang-Chieh Ma as well as our post-doctorate and student users in the cleanroom. My daily tasks include chemical inventory, placing and managing orders, 
              wafer photolithography, metallization, deposition, etching, and more. I help to ensure our cleanroom is effective and usable for both education and research. I am 
              personally involved in research at the VMC, and I am working under Dr. Nibir Dhar to help develop a pinned photodiode FET capable of near-infrared imaging on a germanium 
              substrate, as opposed to the traditional silicon substrates which are widely used in electronics</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">This research experience has given me extensive training across a variety of microelectronic fabrication equipment, and I have also had significant 
              experience and education into the inner workings of the equipment itself. I regularly assist with installing, troubleshooting, maintaining, and monitoring sensitive equipment
              which can be thrown off by a handful of dust, which has given me a much more grounded understanding of the maintenance process in industrial settings. I also had the wonderful 
              opportunity to be mentored by the soon-to-be Doctor Benjamin Horstmann, who was working with the lab for roughly a year of my employment, who had enormous experience in 
              maintaining sensitive equipment and passed it on whenever possible. Ultimately, my time at the VMC has been invaluable to my growth and has helped me to advance my abilities 
              well beyond where I could be through only coursework, and I'm extremely grateful for the people who made this opportunity so meaningful.

            <p class="info-post-text"><b>Position: </b>Engineering Intern</p>
            <p class="info-post-text"><b>Dates: </b>June 2022 — July 2022</p>
            <p class="info-post-text"><b>Job Description: </b>At the Jefferson Lab (JLAB), I worked with an on-site facilities engineer in coordination with Honeywell, a major controls subcontractor working with the lab, to create an enhanced monitoring model for the accelerator's maintenance systems. Our team sought data from JLAB's various sensors as parameters to predict system failures in order to alert onsite engineers before the fault became catastrophic and required shutdown of the accelerator. These parameters were designed to complement a predictive maintenance system that would allow for early notification of predicted failures.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">I was grateful to have another intern working alongside us to achieve our goals, Emmett Souder (pictured above), who made the experience extremely memorable. Working with another inexperienced intern and an extremely-experienced mentor, this internship taught me a lot about team and community dynamics, as well as the ways that communication needs to be handled. We finished our internship by presenting our work to a panel of engineers working with the lab and Honeywell, which was a culmination of both new communication strategies and several weeks of work, classes, compelling guest speakers, and some of the most incredible people I've met in my life.</p>

            <p class="info-post-text"><b>Dates: </b>July 2022 — August 2023</p>
            <p class="info-post-text"><b>Job Description: </b>At Mission BBQ, I worked as both a cashier and expo to deliver a high quality dining experience to guests at the restaurant. I was responsible for taking orders, handling payment, and both assembling and serving food. As a longtime employee, I shifted into a more all-purpose role toward the end of my employment, moving around to assist different employees across all positions in the restaurant and training them in their respective roles.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">While this job may not have had the same engineering-shine as my other work experiences, I gained tremendous experience in communication, leadership, working in a team, conflict resolution, and <i>especially</i> handling stressful work environments.</p>
