            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Background</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">The goal for this project was to develop an online chess game that shocks the player using a low-power taser
              when they make a bad move. The purpose of this was largely for entertainment and does
              not cause significant pain or damage to the players, as this is intended rather to serve as a fun,
              more risky alternative to traditional chess. There were three major parts to be developed for this project: 1) The online chessboard, 2) The taser circuit, and 3) The evaluation AI which scores the player's moves.</p>
            <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/taserChess_board.PNG">
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>1) The Chess Board</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">The chess board was developed using pygame in Python, as a live server which runs in the terminal. This part of the project was 
              primarily programming-focused, and the majority of work done was to get the piece-movement logic working and following the relevant rules of chess.
            </p>
            <p class="info-post-text">This software is the only way to interface with the game, thus any move that happens on the computer must be analyzed and,
              if necessary, the player's taser may need to be activated.
            </p>

            <p class="info-post-header"><b>2) Taser Circuit</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">To activate the tasers using the computer, I first needed to take apart the taser circuits so I could manually
              actuate the taser, instead of using the built-in button.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">I soldered two breadboard wires onto the same headers used for the button circuit, so that when the wires touch, 
              the circuit is completed and the taser activates.</p>
            <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/taserchess-circuit.PNG">
            <p class="info-post-text">With the wires exposed, both were connected to either terminal of a 5-volt relay. The pygame application communicates 
              using pyfirmata with an Arduino Nano, connected via USB. The signal from two of the Nano's digital pins are routed to the gate pin of each player's
              relay, meaning once the digital pin is activated, the taser circuit will be completed.</p>

            <img class="info-post-image-left" src="../Assets/Images/taserchess_evaluation.PNG">
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>3) Evaluation Function</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">The final hurdle to this project was the evaluation function, since I needed to find a way to determine the quality of
              a move compared against every other possible move. This way the player won't simply be tazed for every piece lost, but rather they'll be judged
              based on the context of their turn.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">To accomplish this, I made use of the Stockfish engine library in python, giving me access to an extremely powerful and
              fast minimax search algorithm which is capable of finding a near-best move for any board position. To compare the relative quality of any move the
              player makes, Stockfish is run on the board position prior to their move to determine the current state of the game, indicating the advantage as
              leaning to one player or another. After the player makes their move, this function is re-run on the new board state, which gives a new advantage. This
              change in advantage is then compared against an arbitrary threshold, and if the moving player's advantage falls by more than the threshold, it is
              considered a bad move. This allows some grace for non-optimal but still effective moves from being played, and prevents the players from having to
              figure out what the engine thinks is the best move.
            </p>
