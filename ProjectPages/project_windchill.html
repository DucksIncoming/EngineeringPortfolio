            <p class="info-post-text">Windchill is a game I created as a solo-developer over the course of 8 months, through 2023 and 2024. It's a horror game which draws the player into a mysterious,
              abandoned cabin, where unexplainable events start to reveal themselves. I was responsible for creating 100% of the code, 3D models, controls and UI, and I created a significant share of
              of the textures used in the game. I also created some music and sound effects for the game, and the rest of the textures and audio files are open-source and taken from the web.
            </p>

            <p class="info-post-text">Game development is a unique kind of project to take on, because it demands skill and experience across a wide variety of disciplines, requiring solo developers
              to become a "jack of all trades" of sorts. My existing knowledge of 3D modeling through years of using Blender allowed me to create the 3D models used in the game, and my experience
              using SolidWorks helped to solidfy my understanding of topology and efficient design. My programming abilities were also pushed to their limits, and I spent many long nights trying to
              overcome problems that at the time seemed unsolvable.
            </p>

            <p class="info-post-text">Beyond this, I also had to consider the experience of the players who would be interacting with the game. I ran several playtests with friends and colleagues at
              VCU, and I received a tremendous amount of valuable feedback. Ultimately I was able to execute on my vision of developing a cohesive horror experience, and I was extremely happy with how
              the game plays as a whole.

            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">Game development is something I'm extremely passionate about and I have worked on a variety of smaller game projects besides Windchill, including a procedurally-generated
              3D sandbox where you must build a base and maintain a garden to protect yourself from roaming zombies, platformers, tech demos, and shooter games. Some of these are available on my itch.io account
              at <a href="https://ducksincoming.itch.io/" class="in-text-link">https://ducksincoming.itch.io/</a>. You can find the executable files for Windchill below if you're interested in playing it!
