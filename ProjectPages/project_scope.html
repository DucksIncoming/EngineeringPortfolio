            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Background</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">Whenever I'm working on a project, I tend to find myself 
              with dozens of tabs and programs open, each of which has its own audio settings. 
              All of these overlapping sources can be extremely confusing to work with, as it isn't 
              always clear which application is making sound, and individually muting programs would 
              be extremely tedious and inefficient.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">The goal for this project was to develop a program which could
              automatically detect the application in use and allow only that specific audio source to
              make it through to the user, meaning only tabs actively in use will be able to play audio.
              Scope was developed as a desktop application using python.
            </p>

            <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/scope_settings.png">
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Outline</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">Python was used for this project because of its easy integration with the
              Windows OS audio manager, as well as the many available libraries which tremendously cut down on
              development time. The user interface should include an on/off switch to allow for easily transitioning
              between productive and relaxed work, a section for adding rules governing the audio behavior of
              different applications, and a settings menu to allow the user to specify the minimization and startup
              behaviors.
            </p>

            <img class="info-post-image-left" src="../Assets/Images/scope_newrule.png">
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>OS Integration</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">Before building out the GUI, I first sought to establish a way to control the
              audio of Windows programs through python. To accomplish this, I used the AudioUtilities sublibrary from
              pycaw, which allows for collecting the active audio sessions present on the operating system. This control
              allows the program to set the master volume of any active program, meaning it can mute and unmute them when
              necessary.
            </p>
            <p class="info-post-text">Next, there needs to be a way to distinguish between an active and inactive program.
              Some executables, especially games and media players, prevent audio from being played when the tab is not
              selected, which seems an intuitive enough behavior to apply to this program. This portion used the win32gui
              library which provides information about what is on the user's screen at the OS-level. From these libraries,
              the process ID of the currently selected window can be extracted.
            </p>
            <p class="info-post-text">Finally, these two components can be combined so that they properly moderate the
              audio from inactive programs while allowing audio from the selected window. This now applies to every
              program on the OS, which isn't necessarily desirable as the user may only want to mute specific applications.
              To accomplish this, we must move onto developing the GUI.
            </p>
            
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>GUI Development</b></p>
            <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/scope_dashboard.png">
            <p class="info-post-text">The GUI was created using tkinter and pystray for creating a task tray icon for the
              program. Tkinter is a very powerful graphical design library for python that allows for complex user
              interactions, making it a perfect choice for this project.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p class="info-post-title">Results</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">The program executes flawlessly, with the toggle functionality working
              perfectly to allow a seamless transition between global audio and focus audio. Below is a video
              embed which provides an example of the audio handling capabilities of this program.
            </p>
            <p class="info-post-text">This project not only provided me with an effective tool to manage my
              workflow more efficiently, but also taught me valuable lessons about application programming, GUI
              development, and the importance of designing an effective and intuitive user experience.
