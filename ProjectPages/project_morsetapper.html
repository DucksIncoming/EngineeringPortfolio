            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Objective</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">The goal of this project was to construct and program a mechanism capable of translating speech into 
              interpretable morse code, tapped on the arm of the person wearing the device. This project could have applications for people who are hard 
              of hearing, deaf, or have trouble processing speech as it is spoken, especially as this approach does not require other speakers to understand 
              a separate form of communication such as sign language. The device's  performance is dependent primarily on its ease of use and reliability.</p>

              <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/photo_morse-tapper.png">
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Development</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">This project was made using Python and Visual Studio Code. In order to produce the results expected, there are three primary 
              components that must be considered and fabricated. These include 1) the Speech recognition module, 2) the morse code translator, and 3) the physical tapping mechanism.</p>
              
              <p class="info-post-text">The first of these components is the speech recognition module. In order to translate the speech 
              spoken into the microphone into morse code, the spoken speech must first be converted into text for the computer to parse. Using the Google Cloud’s 
              speech recognition API, along with a Python library that allows easy access to its functionality, this component can be implemented after some settings 
              are tweaked.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">The second component is the morse code translator that translates the speech from the microphone into morse code. Because morse code 
              operates using individual letters rather than entire words, a function that intakes a single character and returns the morse code equivalent can be 
              implemented for each individual character of the returned speech from the speech recognition module.</p>
              
            <p class="info-post-text">Finally, the physical tapping mechanism must be 
              built as the final component. The tapping mechanism is built using an arduino nano with a breadboard that is connected to a SG90 servo motor. This 
              motor receives commands from the Python program dictating the position it must rotate to. The morse code output from the morse code translator can 
              be passed into a handler function that dictates the timings for the servo motor given standard morse code timing and a global variable that alters 
              its overall speed while retaining the proportional differences in certain timings. Finally, using the pyfirmata library to interface with the 
              microcontroller, these commands and timings can be sent to the morse code tapper. Following this, the tapper mechanism can be mounted to the arm of 
              a wearer and the project will be fully functional.</p>

            <p class="info-post-text">Overall, the project worked extremely well and functions exactly as intended. It’s design is compact enough to be mounted to 
              the wearer’s arm and the responsiveness of the speech-to-text API makes utilizing the project reasonable. The project, however, suffers from a few core 
              issues. The speed of the tapper makes longer sentences tedious and difficult to retain in memory when coupled with the requirement of translating the 
              morse code back into english for the wearer. The project in itself serves as more of a learning opportunity and proof of concept, however, therefore 
              these issues are not of extreme importance. Overall, the project was a great success and assisted in my process of learning arduino and servo functionality,
              as well as the design process for developing devices which are meant to interface with regular human interaction.
