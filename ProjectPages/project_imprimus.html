            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Background</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">During my first year at VCU, I was a member of the Mechanical Team with Hyperlabs, an engineering student organiation 
              designed around competing in the Intelligent Ground Vehicles Competition (IGVC). We sought to design a vehicle capable of navigating a complex
              obstacle course without any human input, simulating real-world situations a self-driving vehicle may encounter.</p>
              <p class="info-post-text">Due to some issues among the Computing Team, our team was unfortunately unable to compete in IGVC 2024, however we
                were still able to develop a working prototype that accomplished the major goals set out in the design criteria for the competition.
              </p>
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Planning and Preparation Phase</b></p>
            <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/capstone-expo-2.jpg">
            <p class="info-post-text">When I first joined Hyperlabs, the Mechanical Team consisted of only three members; myself, and the existing two team
              captains. This close-knit team format allowed me to take a much more direct role in the design process than I otherwise would have been able to,
              since I was able to easily access the executives and communicate to them what needs to be accomplished.
            </p>
            <p class="info-post-text">My first major contribution to the project came when we designed the chassis for the vehicle, which was named IMPRIMUS
              early-on, meaning "the first of its kind". I designed the entire exterior vehicle using SolidWorks, utilizing aluminum extrusion for the structural
              elements and machined wooden panels to protect the internal electronics. This design was also chosen specifically to fit within the design footprint
              for the competition and ensure a stable center-of-mass for the vehicle so that it would not overturn.
            </p>
            <img class="info-post-image-left" src="../Assets/Images/capstone-expo-3.jpg">
            <p class="info-post-text">This model provided a reference for the Sensors and Computing teams to implement into their work, and also allowed our team
              to generate a bill of materials for the initial frame assembly. We were able to submit this generated cost analysis as justification for increased
              SGA funding, which allowed us to move forward on the project extremely quickly.
            </p>
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Chassis Assembly</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">The use of aluminum extrusion made our design extremely easy to construct in our university Makerspace. We utilized drop-in
              inserts that allowed for quick assembly and easy resolution of mistakes. We spent a total of 10 man-hours on the frame assembly, then began working
              on the wood panels. These panels were sourced from a local hardware store then cut down to size using a mitre saw. From there, we shaped the panels 
              using a router and jigsaw where necessary, before sanding the pieces smooth.
            </p>
            <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/capstone-expo-3.jpg">
            <p class="info-post-text">These panels were meant to protect the internals of the machine while being easily removable, allowing us to work on the
              internals of the vehicle without issue. We also tested the weight of our components, including the power supply and on-board computer, to ensure
              the vehicle would be stable with this added weight.
            </p>
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Incorporating Sub-teams</b></p>
            <p class="info-post-text">While our team was busy putting together the robot, the Sensor and Computing teams were implementing our design into their
              autonomous simulation software. We also worked with the Power Systems subteam to connect the power supply and UPS. Our team designed a motor mount
              for a wheelchair motor, then 3D printed a prototype to ensure our dimensions were correct. Following this, we submitted a work-order to our Makerspace
              to have the mount machined from aluminum, providing structural stability and reliability for such a heavy component. Finally, after including the 
              wheels and implementing remote control, we had a working vehicle that we could then convert to autonomous.
            </p>
            <img class="info-post-image-left" src="../Assets/Images/capstone-expo-3.jpg">
            <p class="info-post-text">As stated above in the introduction for this project, we unfortunately did not make it to the IGVC 2024 competition because
              we did not have enough confidence in the reliability of our autonomous model. This was a task being handled by the Computing team, however due to
              a combination of a lack of leadership and an inability to retain members, the progress from this sub-team was extremely slow. I made an attempt to
              assist with the programming of the model, however I was still unfamiliar with ROS at the time and was largely only able to help with programming
              concepts and advice. I did learn a tremendous amount about ROS through this experience, but I found it very difficult to both learn and push the
              Computing team forward at the same time.
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Sensor Mounts</b></p>
            <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/capstone-expo-3.jpg">
            <p class="info-post-text">Even after the physical vehicle had been constructed based on our design, we still needed to integrate the necessary sensors
              to provide enough data for the autonomous model to succeed. These included several cameras, both optical and depth-sensing, LiDAR, encoders for wheel
              motion, a kill-switch feature, and much more. I designed several adjustable mounts for these components that were designed to slot into aluminum 
              extrusions using the same drop-in tabs we used for the frame assembly. Some of these designs are listed below:
            </p>
            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Capstone Design Expo 2024</b></p>
            <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/capstone-expo-3.jpg">
            <p class="info-post-text">I traveled with other members of Hyperlabs to present our work at VCU's Capstone Design Expo for Fall 2024. This expo is
              intended for senior design projects and graduate research teams, however our organization was encouraged to submit our work by a number of 
              professors in the College of Engineering. While we didn't make it to IGVC 2024, we still had an impressive prototype that exhibited powerful
              self-navigation abilities, and we spoke to several employers and research teams who were impressed with our progress in just under a year. Ultimately,
              the Capstone Expo was a fantastic experiene and I tremendously enjoyed the opportunity to see what other students were working on, as well as present
              my own work.
            </p>

            <p class="info-post-header"><b>Conclusions</b></p>
            <img class="info-post-image-right" src="../Assets/Images/capstone-expo-3.jpg">
            <p class="info-post-text">Overall I was extremely happy with how this project turned out, and we were successful in developing an autonomous vehicle
              capable of navigating its environment by observing its surroundings. I was able to get a vast array of hands-on experience from this project as well,
              giving me insight into everything from submitting procurement requests, high voltage safety considerations, cost and design analysis, public speaking
              and presenting, and applying engineering principles to solving tangible problems. I had a fantastic time working with Hyperlabs and meaningfully
              connected with many of my team members, and I'm extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to work on such an innovative and interesting project.
