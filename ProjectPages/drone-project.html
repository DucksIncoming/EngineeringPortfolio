            <p class="info-post-text">I attended the Math and Science specialty center at Clover Hill High School, located in Midlothian, Virginia. After high school, I was accepted into the Honors College at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), and began my studies in Fall 2023.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">I was sure of my major almost immediately, as it combined my love for creation and invention with complex problem solving. My experience from my coursework allowed me to design more complex and useful mechanisms than I had ever been able to and reinforced the joy I found in building something new. I chose to double-major in physics in part to improve my ability to handle complex physics problems later in my career, but also because I've been fascinated by physics and the science of the universe my entire life. I hope to come back to my education after I have begun my career to obtain a master's degree in mechanical engineering.</p>

            <p class="info-post-text">In high school, I was the founder and president of our Technology-Student Association, and I spent several club meetings working with other members to help strengthen their programming and design abilities.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">After beginning college, I joined a handful of student organizations and found my place within them. I am currently a member of the Mechanical Team for Hyperlabs, a team that competes in a competition to test designs for an autonomous robot. Additionally, I joined the Game Creator's Coalition, and I used my experience with game development to offer help and guidance to less-experienced members. I am also a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and VCU's IEEE team.</p>
            <p class="info-post-text">I currently have a 4.0 GPA, and I have been on the Dean's List since Fall 2023. My university education has also given me a wide array of knowledge across a variety of relevant classes, the most relevant being: <b>Dynamics & Kinematics</b> (EGMN 201), <b>Engineering Visualization</b> (EGMN 110), <b>Multivariable Calculus</b> (MATH 307), <b>Computational Methods</b> (EGMN 210), <b>Differential Equations</b> (MATH 301), <b>University Physics I</b> and <b>II</b> (PHYS 207 & 208), and <b>Thermodynamics</b> (EGMN 204)</p>
